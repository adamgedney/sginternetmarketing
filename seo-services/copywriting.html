						<h1>SEO Content Copywriting</h1>

						<p>Unless you have a degree in creative or technical writing, SEO Copywriting can be one of the most difficult aspects of building a website. You've built your website, you love it and you want people to start seeing it right away, but you need to fill every page with useful and informative content. Whether you have a 5 page site or a 50 page site, this can be a daunting task to say the least. Knowing how to properly write the content for the best possible ranking results will alow you to get it right the first time.</p>

						<h2>Writing For Humans</h2>
						<p>Far too often we see people make the same mistakes. Don't write for search engines, write for your visitors. Make sure your content flows well, isn't stuffed with keywords, keeps the interest of the reader, uses bullet-points and graphics, avoid large blocks of text, and be sure to use healines, h1 tags, and bold lettering to summarize your content for easier scanning. Start with an outline and be sure to use your keywords where applicable. Chances are, if you write properly for your users, you're going to make it easier for search engines to crawl and index your pages as well.</p>

						<h2>Keyword Density</h2>
						<p>Keyword density is the number, or percentage, of times a keyword appears on a page compared to the total number of words used in your content. Years ago, search engines were easily manipulated by using a certain keyword density formula. In today's world, search engines are much smarter (and getting smarter every day), so this method isn't as effective. There is no exact percentage you should follow, but be sure to use keywords in your page title, meta tags, headers and h1's when possible, as well as throughout your content and image alt tags. Don't over-stuff the keywords into the content with the hopes of ranking higher in search engines.</p>

							<p>Hint: A very good way of ensuring your content is relevant, but not over-stuffed with keywords, is to use variations of the keyword you're focusing on in addition to the exact keyword itself. Search engines use LST (Latent Sematic Text) to display search results based on user intent.</p>

						<h2>Answer User Questions</h2>
						<p>Think about the questions a user might ask about your products or services and include the answers in your SEO Copywriting. If a user asks you a question about a service, they, and others, are likely entering those same questions into Google. </p>

							<p>Hint: Questions can be used in your page titles, blog posts and content headers for better search results. For example, if you're writing a post about "Sharing Website Content", you might use "How do I share my website content?" as the page title.</p>

						<h2>Sharing Your Content</h2>
						<p>You've written your content, you've made sure it's indexed in search engines, and you're ready for the traffic to pour in. Now what? </p>
						<p>Sharing your content on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ are great ways to start the sharing process. If your content is useful and informative, others will likely share your content with their networks as well, but this isn't the only way to get content shared. Post links to your content in forums, social bookmarking sites, reach out to bloggers and other influrncers in your niche or industry, etc. These sites can generate a number of links to your content, which can make your content and site more relevant and establish authority. The more popular and relevant your content becomes, the higher in rankings you will go.</p>

						<h2>Google Author Rank</h2>
						<p>Have you noticed Google search results have begun to display more and more Google+ author content on page 1 search results? These results can be easily identified because they display the photo of the author as well as the authors name and, sometimes, how many Google+ circles they are in.</p>
						<p>Google is starting to pay attention to the authors that write good, quality content that gets shared by other users. It's their way of making sure their social media platform becomes more and more relevant as time goes on. DO yourself a favor and setup a Google+ page, include your author markup on every post or page you create, and watch your author rank soar for better content rankings and authority.</p>
