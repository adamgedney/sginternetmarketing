						<h1>Creating Successful Websites</h1>

						<p>Did you know that you have approximately 5 seconds to grab a website visitors attention and capture their interest? Building a website won't guarantee traffic, sales, or customers. Knowing what people look for on a website that convinces them your business is worthy of their time and money is the first step to knowing how to create a website that will turn your visitors into customers.</p>

						<h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
						<br />
						<p><font color="red">WE PROVIDE A BASIC HOME PAGE DESIGN BEFORE WE CHARGE YOU A SINGLE PENNY!</font></p> 
						<p>This allows you to decide whether we are the right fit for your business and vision before getting stuck in a contract. We know you have a lot of options when it comes to choosing a web designer, so let us show you why you should work with us rather than letting you worry about whether you made the right choice.</p>

						<h2>Intuitive Designs & Layouts</h2>
						<p>Your website design MUST provide the user with a clear path to what you want them to do while they are on your website. Allowing the user to get from point A to point B quickly can be mean the difference between a sale and them leaving your site, never to return. We know where the eye is trained to look first, where to place calls to action, what colors generate the best click-through rates, and proper design elements for maximum exposure of critical information.</p>

						<h2>Effective Messaging</h2>
						<p>A good website provides users with the information they need quickly and efficiently. User experience is incredibly important and lack of trust or poor messaing can kill your ROI. We build websites with these items in mind to increase conversion rates, form subissions, contact requests, and lead generation. </p>

						<h2>SEO Friendly</h2>
						<p>All of our website design projects are coded for optimum search engine performance. There is nothing worse than paying to have a website developed with the intention of working on your search engine optimization later on down the line, only to find out the website isn't setup to achieve high rankings, or any rankings at all due to poor quality coding. We guarantee clean code for easy crawling and indexing by all major search engines.</p>

						<h2>Ecommerce & CMS Systems</h2>
						<p>Interested in creating an online store for your products or services? We have experienced web developers on hand that work with Magento, Shopify and ZenCart. You can choose which platform you'd like to use based on your needs, number of products, and scalability. We also work with CMS platforms such as Wordpress so you can easily update your own blog and web content. Training is available for new users and will be included in the cost when you request a proposal.</p>

						<h2>Mobile Websites</h2>
						<p>When we develop a new website, we ensure that it is fully responsive for optimal mobile and table layouts as well as desktop. This is always included in the cost and development of our websites. If you have an existing website and would like to have a mobile version created, we can do that too! We will design a separate mobile site to look similar to your desktop site for brand recognition and compatibility.</p>

						<h2>New Sites, Redesigns & Existing Site Maintenance</h2>
						<p>Not only do we provide website design and development for brand new sites and businesses, we also work with many clients on redesigning their current sites and updating websites that need a small amount of work completed or features added. There is no job too large or too small. We are happy to work with you and provide the best possible service and suggestions no matter what your budget is or the size of your company.</p>

						<h3>Request a Proposal</h3>
						<p>To <a href="/request-a-proposal.php">request a proposal</a> for website design, development, redesign, or updates to existing websites, please fill out the simple request form and one of our professional representatives will contact you shortly to inquire about your specific needs so we can provide an accurate quote and quickly get you on your way to having a successful website.</p>
