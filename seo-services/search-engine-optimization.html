						<h1>What Is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?</h1>

						<p><span class="bold">Search Engine Optimization</span>, or <span class="bold">SEO</span>, can be described as making sure your website gets found in organic search results when someone searches the internet for information you provide the answer to. A more technical definition would be: the proper implementation of on-site and off-site techniques to make your website perform better and rank higher organically in search engines including Google, Yahoo, Bing, and many others.</p>
						<p>In today's increasingly digital world, having a website is incredibly important, but simply having a website doesn't necessarily mean anyone will see it or be able to find it in the sea of web pages known as the world wide web. <span class="bold">Search Engine Optimization</span> is necessary to ensure your website complies with what the search engines look for to determine where to rank your website in their organic search results when a user enters a query.</p>
						<p>Whether you're a local coffee shop or a fortune 500 company, your website is your digital sales person. You wouldn't send an inexperienced sales person to pitch your product to a major potential client, so why would you let your website be indexed in search engines without being properly optimized for maximum results?</p>

						<h2>Site Structure & Indexing</h2>
						<p><span class="bold">SEO</span> begins with making sure your website uses clean code that can be easily crawled and indexed by search engines. Search engines find a website, follow its internal links to crawl each page and its content, and then index the pages it deems important or useful. Using proper navigation and linking to important data from the home page and internal pages on your site is incredibly important and allows the search engines to figure out what information you want it to display to its users.</p>
						<p>Poor quality coding, lots of flash and animation, too many images, too little content, and other factors can have a negative impact on your search rankings. A good <span class="bold">Search Engine Optimization Company</span> will know to look for these things and make suggestions on how to improve site structure.</p>
						<p>Below are some of the other on-site optimization items a <span class="bold">Search Engine Optimization Company</span> will look for and implement at the beginning of any SEO project:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>proper use and optimization of meta tags</li>
								<li>SEO friendly URL's</li>
								<li>well written, fresh, and unique content that uses keywords, h1 & h2 tags, and titles</li>
								<li>optimization of image alt tags</li>
								<li>proper use of robots.txt files</li>
								<li>use of a custom 404 page for pages that can't be found</li>
								<li>xml and html sitemaps</li>
							</ul>
						<p>There is no use pushing a 5 ton rock uphill, so on-site optimization and site structure MUST be completed before you can begin increasing search engine rankings.</p>

						<h2>SEO Optimized Content</h2>
						<p>Search engines look for well written, fresh, unique  and high quality <a href="/seo-services/copywriting.html">SEO content</a> on a website. Not only does the content need to be well-written, it should also use relevant keywords throughout the titles, headers, and paragraphs in order to tell the search engines what the content is about. 

						<p>SEO content writing tips:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Use compelling headings and titles to provide a clear overview of your content.</li>
								<li>Always write content for the user, not search engines. Make sure it flows well and keeps the readers attention. The longer your readers stay on the page, the more relevant your content will seem to search engines. </li>
								<li>Avoid duplicating anyone elses content as only 1 web page with the same content will usually be indexed and well ranked in search engines (normally the site with more authority).</li>
								<li>Avoid "thin" content that is short and stuffed with keywords to trick search engines into ranking your content higher. Search engines will know what you're up to. Try to write between 300-1000 words and use your keywords in a natural way; about once every 50-100 words on average. </li>
								<li>Use grammatical variations and synonyms of your target keywords. Some search engines use LST (Latent Sematic Text) to display search results based on user intent.</li>
								<li>Think about the questions your visitors would ask you and answer those questions.</li>
								<li>Create a Google+ profile and work on increasing AuthorRank for better Google search results.</li>
								<li>Once again ... don't forget about your meta tags! This is the information displayed in search results, so you'll want a clear and concise description and title.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<h2>Increasing Search Engine Rankings</h2>
						<p>To increase rankings in search engines, you need to generate <a href="/seo-services/backlinks-package.html">high quality backlinks</a> from other website's that point to your website. Search engines assume that the more popular a website is with others, the more releveant and useful it is to their users.</p>
						<p>In past years, the sheer number of backlinks pointing to your website could manipulate the search engines into ranking your website higher, but those days are long gone. They now look at numerous other indicators to determine where to rank your web pages and content: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>How quickly links were generated</li>
								<li>Quality of the links</li>
								<li>Relevance of the sites linking to you</li>
								<li>How many domains link to you vs how many links (1,000 links from 10 domain names is bad news)</li>
								<li>How many IP addresses link to you (a blog network or social bookmarking site network might have different domain names but all reside on the same IP resulting in 1 IP address, but numerous domain names)</li>
								<li><a href="/seo-services/backlinks-package.html">Natural link profile</a> with a good mix of anchor text</li>
							</ul>
						<p>If you're going to take on link building yourself, there are a number of ways good backlinks can be generated:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Write amazing content that will be naturally shared by others.</li>
								<li>Share your content on your social media outlets.</li>
								<li>Create an RSS feed for your site or blog so new content can easily be picked up by others.</li>
								<li>Guest blogging.</li>
								<li>Social media profiles.</li>
								<li>Video submissions.</li>
								<li>Unique article submissions.</li>
								<li>Social bookmarking sites.</li>
								<li>Press releases.</li>
								<li>High quality directory submissions.</li>
								<li>Relevant forum profiles.</li>
								<li>Contributing to conversations and adding comments to relevant forums, blogs, and other outlets that allow author information.</li>
							</ul>
						<p>Be careful not to purchase poor quality links from a less than reputable SEO Company. Poor link quality can cause severe damage to your website that can be incredible time consuming and costly to fix. Ask for references, examples of other domains they have gotten high rankings, and examples of the types of links they build to determine the quality of the service before purchase. You would test drive a used car and check the carfax report before you buy it, so make sure you check the reputation of the SEO Company before you hire them.</p>

						<h2>Mobile Search Engine Optimization</h2>
						<p>It's true ... the world is going mobile. More and more searches are performed every day from a mobile device or tablet. People on vacation looking for restaurants to eat at or attractions to visit nearby, customers looking for or writing reviews of a location, drivers looking for directions, individuals engrossed in conversation looking to prove each other wrong by finding the answer to a question, people looking for an obscure movie quote, etc. In this day and age, it is imperative to cater to your mobile customers.</p> 
						<p>While the fundamentals of optimizing a mobile site are similar to optimizing a desktop site, there are a number of unique differences that only an experienced mobile optimization expert will be able to pinpoint such as using a mobile sitemap format rather than a desktop format, making sure a mobile user gets redirected to your mobile content if you have 2 separate sites for desktop and mobile versions, ensuring Googles desktop search engine doesn't display both desktop and mobile URL's (which may cause duplicate content issues and hurt your rankings). Without proper optimization you could be losing valuable website traffic and visibility.</p>
						<p>If you're considering setting up a mobile site, start by taking a look at <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/details" target="_blank">Google's mobile recommendations</a> to determine the best solution for your business.</p>

						<h2>Ecommerce Search Engine Optimization</h2>
						<p>Ecommerce SEO can be quite complicated. All the basic principles of on-site <span class="bold">search engine optimization</span> apply to ecommerce, but there are a number of additional steps that must be completed as well. If you're building an onine store, it is best to get your web developer and SEO expert working together right from the start. This way the website is designed, developed, and optimized properly from the start without having to go back and make changes.</p>
						<p>Some things to take into consideration when outlining your ecommerce website are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Category and sub category titles and URL's</li>
								<li>site speed and page load time</li>
								<li>product images optimization and server storage</li>
								<li>hosting account size and data usage for scalability</li>
								<li>ecommerce tracking to determine most profiltable keywords and conversion rates</li>
							</ul>
						<p>Choosing an ecommerce platform can also be confusing. With so many options, which one should you choose? There are some fantastic options (our personal preference is Magento because of it's scalability, customization options, and pre-made extensions) that all claim to be "SEO Friendly", but you should know that there are no ecommerce platforms that are perfect right out of the box. Some custom optimization will always be required to ensure maximum search engione rankings and results.</p>
