						<h1>What Is An SEO Audit?</h1>

						<p>
						Performing an <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> on an existing website is the most important and vital step to determining how to improve overall search engine performance, keyword rankings, increase traffic, and create better user experience. Not only does an <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> show you where your current website is lacking, it also shows what your competitors are doing so you can surpass them in search engines. In most cases, by implementing some simple changes, you can take actions to improve your website's search engine visbility almost immediately. 
						</p>

						<h2>Accessibility</h2>
						<p>Search engines need to access and crawl the pages on your website in order to index them in their search results. If the search engines can't access your website, you may as well not even have one.</p> 
						<p>An <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> will determine what pages, if any, cannot be crawled as well as which pages shouldn't be crawled because of "thin content", unecessary folders you don't want to appear in search results (especially for ecommerce sites), or "duplicate content", which can negatively effect your site's rankings and authority.</p>

						<h2>Index Status</h2>
						<p>Find out which website pages are being indexed in Google and other search engines, and why. You may be surprised to find out that none of your websited pges are indexed due to a simple oversight in your robots.txt file, not all of your website pages are indexed or that you have hundreds, or even thoughsands, of pages indexed even though your site is no where near that size.</p>
						<p>Our <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> will determine if your site is properly indexed and if not, we will provide suggested changes to ensure optimum performance and indexing.</p>

						<h2>On-Page Ranking Factors</h2>
						<p>In order to rank highly in search engines, you will need to look at a number of items on your website itself; you must provide valuable content to your audience, optimize each web page properly for the keywords or phrases you're targeting (without over doing it), use proper site architecture for ease of navigation, implement proper inner links to pass "link juice" to the correct pages, ensure load time is fast and efficient, and much, much more ...</p>
						<p>Let us do the technical research and testing for you. Our <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> will analyze 25 different on-page optimization indicators so you don't have to.</p>

						<h2>Off-Page Ranking Factors</h2>
						<p>75-80% of SEO consists of off-page ranking factors. Do you have a natural link profile consisting of the proper mix of anchor text to avoid being penalized by Google? Have you acquired back links too quickly or not fast enough? What do your direct competitors link profiles look like? What quality are the links pointing to your site? Do you have a mix of .org, .gov, and .com sites pointing to your website?</p>
						<p>All of these things are incredibly important to determining how to increase search engine rankings. Our <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> will provide a breakdown of all of your backlinks in an easily readable format that will show how healthy your link profile is, how it can be improved, and how quickly it can be done based on timeframe and budget.</p>

						<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
						<p>The ultimate goal of every website is to be easily found in organic search results. In order to be #1, you have to beat everyone else in your niche. Depending on how competitive your niche is, this can be incredibly difficut, time consuming, and costly.</p>
						<p>Let us show you exactly what needs to be done in order to become #1 in even the most competitive markets. Our <span class="bold">SEO Audit</span> will show you how long, how much, and how difficult it will be before you invest a single penny into an SEO campaign.</p>
