						<h1>Google Algorithm & Penalty Recovery</h1>

						<p>2013 drastically changed the Google search engine landscape and the way website owners are able to make an effort to increase keyword rankings. Gone are the days of purchasing a cheap link package generating thousands of poor quality links for one keyword in the hopes of ranking higher in search engines for that term. Over-optimization of keyword anchor text and poor link quality are now taken into consideration by the all-powerful Google when determining where to rank your site. Well written, useful, and informative <a href="/seo-services/copywriting.html">SEO content</a> and a natural link profile with <a href="/seo-services/backlinks-package.html">high quality links</a> is the ONLY way to rank a website without running the risk of incurring a manual penalty or being effected by an algorithm update in the future.</p>

						<h2>Manual Actions</h2>
						<p>If Google determines your website has too manny Spammy links pointing to (or from) your website or uses tactics that go against their <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en%233">quality guidelines</a> and best practices, they will apply a manual penalty and remove your website from thir index and search results. It is incredibly disheartening when this happens and can seriously effect your business and bottom line. It is possible to have manual actions revoked, but knowing why it happened is the first step to resolving the problem. </p>

						<p>If a manual penalty, or action, is applied to your site, you will receive a notification in your Google Webmaster Tools account under "Search Traffic > Manual Actions". </p>
						<p>According to Google, there are a number of messages you can receive:<br><br>
						<img src="/images/google-manual-actions.png" alt="google manual actions" /></p>
						<p>Out of all of these reasons, by far the most common is the "Unnatural Link Profile" warning:<br><br>
						<img src="/images/unnatural-link-profile.png" alt="unnatural link profile" /></p>

						<h2>Algorithm Updates</h2>
						<p>A more common penalty is the algorithmic penalty. This type of penalty doesn't normally de-index your website from Google's index and search results, but will decrease your websites rankings, sometimes significantly. This can be confusing for website owners because there is no warning; no manual action or notification appears in Google Webmaster Tools. A website owner will simply see a major decrease in website traffic and rankings on, or around, the day a new algorithm update is released.</p>
						<p>Algorithm updates are released periodically by Google, with no set schedule, because they are constantly trying to clean up the web and remove Spam sites and sites with thin or low-quality content. These updates act as filters and automatically determine where your website should rank based on over 200 factors. Knowing what date the drop in rankings and traffic occured, and why, is the first step to understanding how to get your rankings back.</p>

						<h2>Natural Link Profiles</h2>
						<p>A websites link profile consists of all of the hyperlinks pointing to it and the alt text, or link text, that was used as the link itself. Let's start by understanding the anatomy of a text link:</p>
						<p>This example link points to our websites home page and uses "SEO Services" as the alt text, anchor text, or link text:</p>
						<p><a href="/index.php">SEO Services</a></p>
						<p>To increase search engine rankings for a keyword, for example "SEO Services", you will need to get other websites to add text links to their sites that point to yours using the anchor text you wish to increase ranking for (as shown above for "SEO Services)". But, that's not all. Less than 50% of your overall link profile should be exact match keyword anchor text links. A natural link profile will also include links using your websites URL, company name, "click here", "read more", and variations of the keywords you wish to rank for, for example "SEO Company Services", "Click here for SEO Services Information", etc.</p>
						<p>Taking an in-depth look at your link profile can provide valuable information into why you may have lost rankings during an algorithm update. If you're over-optimized for a particular keyword, this can help you understand what other links need to be built in order to even out the keyword anchor text in your link profile.</p>
						<p>Google Webmaster Tools provides a number of backlinks under "Search Traffic > Links To Your Site", but does not provide all links as the web is a very large place and even Google can't tell you everything about it. We use other tools in addition to Webmaster Tools, such as <a href="https://ahrefs.com">Ahrefs.com</a>, to help gather the most backlinks to determine what needs to be done to get your rankings back on track.</p>

						<h2>Low Quality Backlinks vs. High Quality Backlinks</h2>
						<p>Low quality links can be described as links that come from Spam directories, poorly spun articles, too many forum profiles and comments (too much of any one kind of link is usually bad), sites that have nothing to do with your niche or profession, sites that have been deindexed by Google, site-wide links in the footer or sidebars of other sites, and sites with no pagerank or a very low pagerank (although this doesn't matter as much as it used to). Having some of these links is almost unavoidable since peopel are free to post links on their sites as they see fit. If a webmaster doesn't realize the effects of the link they placed on their site, it is OK to reach out to them and ask them to remove it or make it a "no-follow" link. </p>
						<p>High quality links are links that point to your site from sites with a high page rank, .gov and .edu sites, trusted brand name websites, highly ranked sites that have been around for quite some time, sites that are closely related to your niche or profession. </p>

						<h2>Getting Your Google Rankings Back</h2>
						<p>To get your rankings back, you'll need to start by doing the following:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Check Google Webmaster Tools for a manual action message</li>
								<li>Resolve manual action issues and subit site for reconsideration</li>
								<li>If no manual action, analyze your link profile</li>
								<li>Determine date and cause of algorithmic penalty by looking for drop in rankings and traffic</li>
								<li>Clean up link profile</li>
								<li>Submit disavow file to Google with poor quality links you were unable to remove from web</li>
								<li>Continue building links </li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Penalty Recovery can be an incredibly tedious and time consuming process. We can help you determine tha cause of the penalty, fix the problem, and continue building <a href="/seo-services/backlinks-package.html">high quality backlinks</a> to avoid penalties and for increased rankings no matter how many times Google rolls out algoithm updates and Spam filters.</p>
